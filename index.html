- How can I get rid of the white space between my header/main/footer?
- Does Github update the files automatically? or do I need to keep uploading the files over and over again? 
- I want to work more on my webpage but I am too far behind in my modules :(

        <h3>Hi! I'm Chris Goyette</h3>
          <p>I am a software developer living in the Bay Area.</p>
          <p>In my last job I was working in fintech as a Fraud Analyst for a peer-to-peer lending company.</p>
          <p>After getting laid off, I realized that I wanted more in life and that I needed to be more valuable to society. That's when I decided that I wanted to level up my skills and become a software developer.</p>
